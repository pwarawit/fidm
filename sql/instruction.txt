This is how to execute SQL command files from Windows via psql

1. Set environment variables
----
set PGHOST=158.108.95.7
set PGPORT=5432
set PGDATABASE=fidm
set PGUSER=fidm
set PSQL_EDITOR=gvim

2. Location of psql executable (c:\program files\postgresql\9.3\bin)
----
* It would be best to also add this into %PATH%

3. Otherwise - use this as place holder
psql -h 158.108.95.7 -p 5432 -d fidm -U fidm 

"c:\program files\postgresql\9.3\bin\psql" -h 158.108.95.7 -p 5432 -d fidm -U fidm -f
